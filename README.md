# EEG_Deep_Learning
Attention classification using deep learning with EEG data.
Run Spectrogram_CNN_RNN_regression.ipynb for the Time Domain model.
Run Final_Periodogram.ipynb and Final_Regular_NN.ipynb for the Frequency Response models.

Earlier Milestones:
Run the RNN_implementation.ipynb to train a CNN+RNN using time domain information.
Run the Regular_NN.ipynb to train an ANN using frequency domain information.
